##Operating Systems
in this section you can find official BSD OSes links (in alphabethical order ) with short description as can be found on their pages. 

###DragonFly BSD
DragonFly belongs to the same class of operating systems as other BSD-derived systems and Linux. It is based on the same UNIX ideals and APIs and shares ancestor code with other BSD operating systems. DragonFly provides an opportunity for the BSD base to grow in an entirely different direction from the one taken in the FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD series.

###FreeBSD
FreeBSD is an advanced computer operating system used to power modern servers, desktops and embedded [platforms](https://www.freebsd.org/platforms/). A large [community](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/contributors/staff-committers.html) has continually developed it for more than thirty years. Its advanced networking, security and storage features have made FreeBSD the platform of choice for many of the [busiest web](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/nutshell.html#introduction-nutshell-users) sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices.

###NetBSD
NetBSD is a free, fast, secure, and highly portable Unix-like Open Source operating system. It is available for a wide range of platforms, from large-scale servers and powerful desktop systems to handheld and embedded devices. Its clean design and advanced features make it excellent for use in both production and research environments, and the source code is freely available under a business-friendly license. NetBSD is developed and supported by a large and vivid international community. Many applications are readily available through pkgsrc, the NetBSD Packages Collection.

### OpenBSD
The OpenBSD project produces a FREE, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. Our efforts emphasize portability, standardization, correctness, [proactive security](http://www.openbsd.org/security.html) and [integrated cryptography](http://www.openbsd.org/crypto.html). As an example of the effect OpenBSD has, the popular [OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com/) software comes from OpenBSD.
